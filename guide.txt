HitshoAutosell Guide

Thank you for choosing HitshoAutosell to optimize your Roblox UGC limited item sales! This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and use the program effectively. Before you begin, make sure you have the latest version of Python installed on your system.

Step 1: Download the Latest Version

Go to the GitHub repository for HitshoAutosell: https://github.com/hitshoCodes/HitshoAutosell.
Click on the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP."
Save the ZIP file to your preferred directory on your computer.
Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder.

Step 2: Configure Webhook

Open the settings.json file using a text editor.
Locate the "WEBHOOK_URL" field and replace "your_webhook_url" with the URL of your webhook.
Save the changes and close the file.

Step 3: Choose Your Selling Method

Open the settings.json file in a text editor.
Locate the SELL_METHOD variable and set it to your liking.
There will be 2 things important to change and this is what they do:
For the "undercut" method, HitshoAutosell will automatically list items for one Robux less than the current lowest price.
For the "custom" method, you'll need to specify the item ID and the desired selling price in the custom_items dictionary in the settings.json file.

Step 4: Run HitshoAutosell

Double-click on HitshoAutosell.py
If it crashes, you did something wrong, redo the steps. If it continues, contact me on Discord: hitsho_

Step 5: Monitor Sales via Webhooks

Sit back and relax! HitshoAutosell will automatically handle your UGC limited item sales. Whenever an item is sold, you'll receive real-time notifications via the webhook you configured.

Note: Use at Your Own Risk

While we've taken care to ensure the safety and functionality of HitshoAutosell, remember that using third-party tools with your Roblox account comes with risks. Always exercise caution, and we cannot be held responsible for any unintended consequences, including the loss of Robux or other in-game assets.
